### Lace Stancil Clock

My clock ideal is an old fashion clock that surrounded by a lace stancil theme. It has roman numerals to reading a time on the clock. My lace stancil idea was developed from the old idea, which is a nature time idea. On the lace stancil is a flower pattern in the clock. It would similar likes a gear inside a clock. The lace stancils are the inner, midder, and outer rings on the clock. They are animating by rotation around the clock as seconds and millis timing. The rotation of lace stancil will be running faster in the alarm function.
